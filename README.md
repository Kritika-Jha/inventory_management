An Inventory Management System using:

Tech Stack
This project is built using the following technologies:

Frontend:
HTML: The structure of the web pages is built using HTML. It provides the skeleton for the content, such as forms, tables, and other essential elements.
CSS: Used to style the frontend components and layout. CSS ensures the application is visually appealing and responsive across devices. We used custom styles and potentially some CSS frameworks for improved design.
JavaScript (JS): JavaScript powers the interactivity of the frontend, from handling user events to dynamic updates of the user interface.

Backend:
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used to build the backend server. It allows us to use JavaScript on the server-side, making it easier to handle requests, manage APIs, and interact with databases.
Express.js: A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It simplifies routing, request handling, and middleware integration, allowing us to build APIs and handle HTTP requests efficiently.

Database:
MySQL: A relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and manage the data in our application. We use SQL queries to interact with the database, manage products, suppliers, and inventory data.
SQL Views: Weâ€™ve created several views (e.g., product_inventory_view, supplier_product_view, product_stock_status_view) to optimize complex queries, making it easier to retrieve data for the frontend.
